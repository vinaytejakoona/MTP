       "'Road Condition of Ejipura after the sewage pipe line work Dear All,\\\\n\\\\nI am writing this email to you as a resident of Ejipura location in distress for more than 3 weeks.\\\\nI know for the fact that BBMP / BWSSB has taken initiative to lay new drainage pipe lines for most locations in Ejipura. However it looks like there is no progress at all.\\\\n\\\\nThe pipelines are layed, however the work is half done. No one really bothers how the residents manage the rest of the day and even in case of any emergency, we cannot take our car or ambulances inside. We have many senior citizens and children\\\\\\'s living here and they have horrible time trying to cross these broken road & potholes. It\\\\\\'s only matter of time when something bad happens & we are in the \\\\\"TV News\\\\\"!!\\\\n\\\\nI am sharing some of the pictures taken at Ejipura, Sri Rama Temple Road - 20th C Cross (beside ICICI ATM), the work is as it is and no one is really bothered to fix the problem. I have raised a complaint in both BWSSB and BBMP grievances site, there has been no response or calls whatsoever.\\\\n\\\\nMy humble request is to please have this road fixed as quickly as possible. We have been trying to manage our lives with this road conditions allover Bangalore, but this is worst. Our vechicals and cars are getting damaged and even sometimes stuck in muddy poth holes.'"

Most common offenders are Autos  and Cabs.\\nWhen I spoke to ACP, Traffic, Bengaluru, Dr.Saleem, he told me that this is not under Traffic Police\\'s duties. Traffic Police is responsible for ensuring traffic moves properly, not the lung damage unchecked vehicles are causing in Bengaluru.\\nI disagree to his stand. If that is the case, then, everytime there is road rage, Traffic Police can raise their hands saying, it is Crime Dept\\'s job only. But, Crime Dept would need Traffic Police\\'s help to work together and resolve cases.\\nThe truth of the matter is that the various Govt Departments in Bengaluru need to work in harmony for better lives of people. \\n\\nI shall call KSPCB regarding this as well. Will update the complaint shortly.\\nA strong step needs to be taken for this asap. This step would need BTP, KSPCB and Transport Dept to work together to ensure that the culprit vehicle is made to correct it\\'s emissions and fined as soon as possible. \\n\\nThe mindset has to change regarding this important aspect. The unrest and road-rage in Bangalore traffic is partly due to the agitation polluted air causes in our bodies. Our lungs deserve good fresh air and not suffer because of the neglect by irresponsible citizens.\\n\\nThanks and Regards,\\nNeha\n",

We also cannot dry clothes in the open because of the same problem. In short, the dust is omnipresent in the area.\n",

      "Secondly, almost everyone in our area susceptible to stroke of Asthma and Bronchitis and lung inflammation. So the health hazards are very serious in nature.\n",
      "So we people think that, the authorities should take steps to gradually shift the factories outskirts and as early as possible.There are a couple of cement factories in the Doddanakundi Industrial Area and the service road from marathahalli total mall to ITPL is crowded with lots of lorries and trucks plying through day and night carrying loads of cement, sand and stones. The entire stretch of road till kundanahalli has become difficult for pedestrians. The dust is beyond limits and there are many apartments here, close to 10000 families residing. The new apartments are getting constructed as well. Our kids fall sick very often. Cough and cold, dry cough asthma and chest infection have become very common to our families. Winters are really scary, such horrifying dust with added cold. We are really scared if this is carcinogenic. There has often been a difficulty in breathing.  There has been a lots of complaints raised on this regard since a year ago and no promising actions have been taken, rather the approval for many newer apartments are given despite the cement and dust levels.  Though, there has also been a mention about the pollution levels and the cement dust in Doddanakundi and Graphite India many a times in newspapers and media from 2012 on-wards, still there has been no plausible outcome.

My house lies behind a lane of trees planted along the periphery of the Post and Telegraph (P&T) staff quarters. The residents of the apartment belonging to the colony have made it a habit to dispose garbage into an open area right behind my house. Taking a glance at the litter, one can find polythene bags of white and black color, disposed diapers & sanitary pads, polythene bags containing disposable waste, wrappers of wafers and biscuits and larger polythene bags from supermarkets containing more plastic. Every week BBMP workers (ward 32) arrive with their brooms, clean up the roads, precipitate the dried leaves and disposed wrappers on to the outer periphery of the road and set fire. The practice has been long enough as old as 8 years. No action about proper disposal has taken place since then, or it may be that people have become increasingly careless about the environment. Does one know that burning plastic causes cancer and breathing disorders for the entire neighborhood and the surrounding areas? I provide this link: http://www.carahealth.ie/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=228%3Athe-danger-of-burning-plastic-&catid=218%3Abreast-cancer&Itemid=221&lang=en in creating awareness.

The road In Prashanth Layout extension which connects from Whitefield main road to GR tech park back gate, the roads were laid 6 months back, but only upto 60%, the remaining is mud road which causes air pollution due to dust flying all around even after a two wheeler passes around. Also the road from hopefarm junction to whitefield is in pathetic condition due to the recent BWSSB work and here too there is huge dust all over the road. Why is it that no one from the BBMP or government is concerned about this? Who is the responsible person for all these? I even filed an RTI for this pathetic road condition, but there is no response from anyone. Even BWSSB  dug up ECC road and nothing has been done to relay the roads and this is the status for the last 1 month. On top of that, there are many 2 wheeler accidents in these areas due to poor roads and no one is concerned about this.
