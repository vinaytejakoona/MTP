Since there is no stop line marked, the stop line is up to the imagination of impatient drivers. During the absence of a police person, the impatient drivers encroach and fill the slowest lane of Old Madras Road (OMR). This makes it hard for a \nmotorist travelling east on the slowest (leftmost) lane (OMR), who must change over the middle east-bound OMR lane. Further, if the lights just change from green to red (there appears to be a very short change-over time I noted few weeks ago), on east-bound OMR, slowest lane, the impatient drivers on NGEF road already proceed in south direction.
